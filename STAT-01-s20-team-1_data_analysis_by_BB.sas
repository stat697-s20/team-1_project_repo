Question 1 of 4: How does the type of school effect ELs and LEP student's in 
meeting UC/CSU entrance requirements? Also how does this varry between 
ethnicities?

environment that is best for students who are ELs and LEP students?

requirements for UC/CSU?

Rationale: Having an understadnign of how the various factors effect ELs and

Question 3 of 4: What are the odds that a specified student ethnicity will meet 
admission requirements compared to a 'White, not Hispanic' student?

Rationale: From the odds we can gain a better perspective on the success rates
of underserved/ underrepresented student populations compared to their 'White, 
not Hispanic' peers, and learn which student population need the most additional
support.

Question 4 of 4: What are the odds that a ELs/LEP student will meet admission 
requirements compared to non ELs/LEP student?

Rationale: From the odds we can gain a better perspective on the success rates
of ELs/LEP students compared to non ELs/LEP strudents to see just how much any
descrpencies in support impacts this student population.
