"According to the Education Commission of the States, Charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor)."

/*
Note: This compares the column CharterSchool with Met UC/CSU Grad Req (Count). 
We can use paired test to compare the differences between Charter School and 
non-Charter School.

Limitations: For data rows with an asterisk (indicating the number of entry is 
less than 10 to protect the students) should be excluded since it doesn't 
showany true values. Also, we should compare the number of count instead of 
rate since when we calculate the number of students from the rate, it will show 
decimals which is impossible for number of counts.

Methodology: We sort the ranking of Meeting UC/CSU Grad requirement to see the 
trend of number of students met the requirement to enter colleges with respect 
to Charter School or not.

Followup Steps: Afterwards we can try to see if if the "Reporting Category"
also is a factor affecting the percentage of meeting UC/CSU Grad requirement.

Note: This compares the column ReportingCategory, Seal of Biliteracy (Count) 
with the Regular HS Diploma Graduates (Count). We can use categorical data
analysis methods to determine this.

Limitations: For data rows with an asterisk (indicating the number of entry is 
less than 10 to protect the students) should be excluded since it doesn't show
any true values. Also, we should compare the number of count instead of rate 
since when we calculate the number of students from the rate, it will show 
decimals which is impossible for number of counts.

Methodology: We can use porc sort to find which ethnicity has the most number
of Biliteracy Rate to see how the ethnicity and language affects the graduate
rate. Then we use barchart to see the rate of Diploma Graduates across the three races with biliteracy, White, Hispanic and Asian.

Followup Steps: We should see the entries that without a numerical value as it 
doesn't contains a figure of the reporting category. We should filter it for 
more accurate result. Also, we can try to see if there are correlation between the number of high school graduates and the biliteracy rate.

Note: In data set 3, elsch19 there is a column "LANGUAGE" which can be relate 
to the column "ReportingCategory" where the "ReportingCategory" in dataset 
acgr19 & acgr18 are the reported race/ethnicity and gender. We can use 
categorical data analysis methods to determine this.

Limitations: For data with column LANGUAGE marked as Other non-English 
languages (Column LC = 99) should be excluded since it doesn't show which type 
of languages they use and can not relate to the column ReportingCategory. We 
also exclude the data with Not Reported in the column ReportingCategory as it 
doesn't have any value for analysis.

Methodology: Using proc sgplot to plot the distribution of total number of 
english learner according to their "reporting category". Then we use proc corr 
to see the correlation between Asian and Hispanic graduation counts. Here we 
exclude White because we assume the first language of students with ethicity 
White is English.

Followup Steps: There is a possible way to see if there are differences in
comparing difference language users, their graduation rate and those kids
with first language in English by setting up the ANOVA between average rate
of different first language students in different counties.
